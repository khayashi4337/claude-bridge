# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new project (`study_chrome`) - currently an empty workspace awaiting initialization.

## Getting Started

This project needs to be initialized. Based on the project name, this may involve Chrome/Chromium-related development (extension development, browser automation, or Chromium source study).

### Common Setup Paths

**For Chrome Extension Development:**
```bash
# Initialize npm project
npm init -y

# Create extension structure
mkdir -p src/{background,content,popup}
```

**For Puppeteer/Playwright Browser Automation:**
```bash
npm init -y
npm install puppeteer  # or playwright
```

## Current State

- No source code, build system, or tests configured yet
- No git repository initialized
- Project structure to be determined based on development goals
